# RestaurantFinder
RestaurantFinder is an in-the-works personal project with the goals of mitigating indecisiveness when it comes to going out to eat and finding new restaurants to try!

Ideally, RestaurantFinder will have the following features:
* Ability to receive random suggestions for restaurants to try based on filter criteria
* Ability to review restaurants visited for future reference

While I will likely explore hosting this project in the cloud as a website available on the internet, I currently do not plan to allow anyone other than myself access to it unless good reason arises. Feel free to reach out if interested!
